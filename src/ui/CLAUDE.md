# src/ui/ — classic HUD, i18n, procedural icons

The classic-MMO HUD: unit/party frames, action bar, all windows, tooltips,
world map + minimap, combat log, floating combat text. Plus the locale table and
runtime-drawn icons.

## How this area works
- **Plain DOM + canvas, no UI framework.** The HUD queries pre-existing DOM
  (`$('#…')` → `index.html`) and builds the rest with `innerHTML` /
  `createElement`. There is no virtual DOM, reactivity, or component lib.
- **Reads from / acts through `IWorld` only** (`world_api.ts`). The HUD renders
  world state and dispatches every player action through `IWorld`; it never
  imports `Sim`/`ClientWorld` (see src/ CLAUDE.md). It also takes `Renderer` +
  out-of-band glue via `OptionsHooks`/`ReportHooks` wired by `main.ts`.
- All HTML interpolation goes through `esc()`. **Never `innerHTML` raw
  player/server text** — names, chat, guild names, etc. must pass through `esc`.

## UI/UX, mobile & accessibility standards
The HUD ships to real players on desktop **and** phones, so every visible control is
held to these — verify in mobile portrait *and* landscape before calling UI work done.
- **Aesthetic:** premium dark-fantasy theme (deep darks, gold-brown accents, rich
  borders); avoid default browser-chrome looks. **No raw emojis as in-game icons** —
  use the procedural `icons.ts` recipes (below) or real art. Transitions are smooth
  and interruption-safe (cross-fades), never causing layout shift.
- **Layout stability:** content updates must not resize the parent, jump, or clip.
  Prefer `width:100%` + `max-width` over viewport units like `92vw` (they overflow
  once margins/padding are added). Flex/grid + fluid type; no ad-hoc inline styles.
- **Mobile touch** (gate on touch capability / runtime state, not only `max-width` —
  landscape phones need it too):
  - Every visible `input`/`select`/`textarea` is **≥16px** font, or iOS Safari
    auto-zooms the page on focus (iOS 10+ ignores the viewport `user-scalable=no`/
    `maximum-scale`, so font-size is the only reliable fix). This is enforced centrally
    by a `@media (pointer: coarse) { input, textarea, select { font-size: 16px !important } }`
    floor in `index.html` (mirrored in `admin.html`), so new controls are covered for free
    even when their own rule out-specifies a plain catch-all; the `!important` is what
    wins. Don't set a per-control mobile font below 16px, and don't lean on the viewport
    scale-lock. Regression check: `node scripts/mobile_input_zoom_check.mjs` (needs `npm run dev`).
  - Every tappable target (buttons, links, selects, tabs, icon-only controls, anything
    with `role="button"|"tab"|"option"`) stays **>=40x40px** on mobile touch controls
    (the preferred floor); 24x24px (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8) is the absolute minimum, used only
    where 40x40 is genuinely infeasible. Do NOT weaken the 40x40 floor to 24px.
  - Narrow headers collapse to a hamburger drawer rather than wrapping/overflowing.
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA):** full keyboard operation (Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Space);
  high-contrast `:focus-visible` on every custom interactive element; correct
  semantics / ARIA (`role`, `aria-selected`, `aria-pressed`, `aria-invalid`,
  `aria-describedby`, `tabindex`); honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (drop cross-fades,
  content translations, camera auto-rotate); **no `transform: scale()` on hover/focus**
  of list/rail/chip items (motion-sickness trigger); text contrast ≥4.5:1 (≥3:1 large).
  Accessible names are still `t()` keys (see i18n below).
- **HUD-chrome WCAG 2.2 AA contract (what the chrome a11y work built and guards).** The chrome
  (windows, buttons, forms, menus, chat, tooltips) is in scope; the 3D world / game
  canvas is OUT of scope (not screen-readable, never faked with aria). On top of the
  per-control basics above:
  - **Focus management:** opening a window TRAPS Tab/Shift+Tab inside it and RETURNS focus
    to the opener on close, via the one shared `FocusManager` (`src/ui/focus_manager.ts`,
    exporting `FocusManager` + `FOCUSABLE_SELECTOR`), which `Hud` drives through its
    `windowFocus(rootSel)` wrapper; the trap intercepts Tab only when focus is already inside
    (Tab is the game's target-nearest key, so an unconditional trap would hijack it). Esc
    stays with the single `closeAll` dispatcher, not the manager.
  - **Visible focus that never animates away:** every OUTLINE-based `:focus-visible` ring is
    steady and drawn from a token / system color, never a raw hex, never `transition`ed /
    animated / blurred off (`tests/focus_visible_guard.test.ts` is outline-scoped; the few
    box-shadow/border focus indicators are caught by the forced-colors net below).
  - **Skip links** ("Skip to Main HUD" / "Skip to Chat") are the first focusable elements;
    **live regions** announce chat (`#chatlog` role=log) and combat (off-screen
    `#combat-live` role=status, throttled per type by `src/ui/live_region_politeness.ts`).
  - **`forced-colors: active`** is the only AUTOMATIC contrast adaptation (no
    `prefers-color-scheme` auto-switch): borders + the focus ring survive via system-color
    keywords; meaning is never carried by a background-image alone. (The theme picker also
    offers user-selectable presets, including a light `parchment` and a `highContrast`; see
    `src/styles/CLAUDE.md`.)
  - **No viewport scale-lock:** `user-scalable=no` / `maximum-scale` are dropped (WCAG SC
    1.4.4 / 1.4.10); the 16px input-font floor is the anti-zoom guard.
  - Enforced always-on (every `npm test`) by `tests/focus_manager.test.ts`,
    `tests/focus_order.test.ts`, `tests/focus_visible_guard.test.ts` (rings steady +
    token-drawn), `tests/live_region_politeness.test.ts`, `tests/combat_announcer.test.ts`,
    and `tests/client_shell.test.ts` (skip links first-focusable, the live regions, the
    dropped scale-lock, the forced-colors/print CSS, role=group/progressbar in both
    entries). The axe-core + keyboard-reachability + rendered target-size checks are the
    OPT-IN browser suite `tests/browser/*.browser.test.ts` (`npm run test:browser`, via
    `vitest.browser.config.ts`, chromium-only locally). Wiring that suite (and axe) into a
    standing CI job on WebKit/Firefox + mobile WebKit was prototyped + verified green
    but reverted with the declined bundle work; it remains an OPTIONAL standalone re-land.

## Per-frame performance contract (write-elision + tiering)
Per-frame HUD code (anything reached from `Hud.update()`) holds these, proven by the
per-frame painters:
- **Write-elision.** Every per-frame DOM write goes through the host's elided writers
  (`setText`/`setDisplay`/`setTransform`/`setWidth` + the multi-slot
  `setStyleProp`/`toggleClass`/`setAttr`), bound over the private `hotWriteCache` field in
  `src/ui/hud.ts` (grep the field + the writer methods, do not chase line numbers) and
  exposed to painters via `src/ui/painter_host.ts` (`PainterHostWriters` / `makeWriterFacet`).
  The cache key is byte-identical so an unchanged value skips the DOM, and `perfStats()`
  exposes the skip-rate. ALSO elide the expensive upstream RESOLVE, not just the write: diff
  a stable key and re-run the costly producer (icon data-URL, image decode, tooltip HTML)
  only when the key changes (`action_bar_painter` `lastIcon`, `auras_painter` `lastIconKey`,
  `unit_portrait_painter` `imgCache`). The elision MECHANISM is enforced always-on by
  `tests/painter_host.test.ts` (write once, elide byte-identical repeats, key per element,
  namespace per slot); the separate rule that a painter never calls `el.textContent =` /
  `style.*` / `setAttribute` / `innerHTML` directly is enforced by the per-painter source
  scans (e.g. `tests/action_bar_painter.test.ts`, `tests/auras_painter.test.ts`).
- **Allocation-light cores.** A per-frame view-core returns a REUSED, preallocated
  container + slots (no per-frame array/object garbage); jitter/clock stay in the painter,
  never the core. Enforced always-on by the reference-stability probe
  `tests/util/alloc_probe.ts` (driven by `tests/alloc_probe.test.ts` plus the per-frame
  view tests, e.g. `tests/auras_view.test.ts`, `tests/action_bar_view.test.ts`).
- **The perf gate.** `scripts/perf_tour.mjs` (an env-driven `npm run` script, run per
  per-frame phase against the recorded baseline) asserts `frameP95 <= baseline` and that
  the AoE-burst FCT node count stays bounded; it also REPORTS `hudHotDomSkipRate`, which
  each per-frame phase checked against the baseline at its green gate (perf_tour does NOT
  auto-fail on skip-rate, so the always-on write-elision guarantee is the
  `tests/painter_host.test.ts` guard above). Each green-gate commit is TAGGED so a later
  cumulative regression bisects to a commit. The STANDING vitest perf budget is
  `tests/hud_perf_budget.test.ts`, split by host so each assertion runs where it is
  measurable: ARM 1 (Node, every `npm test`) scans every hot painter for raw writes AND
  per-frame forced-reflow layout reads (offsetWidth/getBoundingClientRect/..., the layout-
  thrash killer); ARM 2 (Node fake-DOM, every `npm test`) drives the non-pooled per-frame
  painters through a steady loop over a real `makeWriterFacet` and asserts per-painter
  establishing-write + elision + a derived skip-rate sanity bound (its loop has a FIXED
  denominator so the ratio is stable here), for BOTH a Sim- and a ClientWorld-shaped input
  plus the `alloc_probe` reference-stability proxy (container AND `.slots`);
  ARM 3 (gated behind `HUD_PERF_BUDGET_TOUR=1`, the perf row, skipped in bare `npm test`)
  reads a `perf_tour` artifact + the baseline and asserts `frameP95 <= reference` and, on
  EVERY viewport, the run-length-INDEPENDENT elision-bypass COUNT `hudHotDomWrites <= 152`
  (NOT the skip RATIO, whose denominator is the frame count and jitters run-to-run: a clean
  re-run measured desktop 0.959 vs 0.962 with hotWrites still 152), plus the FCT pool stays
  at/under `FCT_POOL_CAP`. The committed baseline (`perf-baseline-v016.md`) is READ for both
  the 0.962 ARM-2 floor and the 152 bypass anchor (it throws if absent, never defaults).
  perf_tour's mobile profile boots (landscape 844x390 + `#mobile-preflight` dismissal). The
  first all-together run held with no per-frame regression.
- **Two controllers stay separate.** HUD tier knobs read the STATIC graphics preset via
  `src/game/ui_effects_profile.ts` (the `data-fx-level` stamp), NEVER `governor.state()`;
  `Hud.fxTier()` resolves the static stamp through `coerceFxTier`. This is the perf half of
  the gameplay-neutral-graphics invariant (root `CLAUDE.md`). Guarded by
  `tests/ui_tier_knobs.test.ts` (the import-absence + behavioral two-controller scan), the
  `ui_tier_knobs` purity row in `tests/architecture.test.ts`, and
  `tests/ui_effects_profile.test.ts` (the static-preset to effect-token resolver behind the
  `data-fx-level` stamp).

### Canvas and DOM hot-path techniques (the proven patterns)
The contract above is the WHAT; these are the HOW the per-frame painters use to hit it. Reach
for the matching one when you build a hot HUD component (each names its exemplar):
- **Resolve element refs ONCE** into a field at construction, never `$()`/`querySelector`
  from a per-frame path (a re-query every frame was a real leak; `hud.ts` caches
  `xpbarEl` / `playerFrameEl` / `swingbarEl`).
- **Pool + keyed-reconcile, never per-frame `innerHTML` / `createElement`.** For a per-event
  or per-entity collection (FCT, auras, party), keep a persistent node pool, reconcile a
  keyed list with minimal `insertBefore` moves (a steady-state frame moves nothing), recycle
  departed nodes, and CAP the live count (FIFO-evict past the cap). `auras_painter` (keyed
  pool + `reconcileOrder`), `fct_painter` (pool + FIFO cap).
- **Offscreen-canvas background cache.** Render static geometry (terrain, schematic) ONCE to
  a detached canvas keyed by what it depends on (zone+seed, module id), then `drawImage`-blit
  it each redraw; only the dynamic markers re-stroke per frame. `delve_map_painter`
  (`buildSchematicBg`); the Hud-owned per-zone `mapBgCache` blitted by `map_window_painter`;
  the minimap blits its own whole-world `minimapBg` terrain canvas.
- **Set loop-invariant canvas state once.** Assigning `ctx.font` re-parses the font string
  every time, so set `font` / `fillStyle` / `lineWidth` before a draw loop, not per glyph
  (`map_window_painter`).
- **DPR backing store only where it must be crisp.** A HiDPI canvas sizes its backing store
  to `devicePixelRatio` and reassigns `width`/`height` only when the DPR changes (assignment
  clears the canvas); portraits are DPR-scaled (`unit_portrait_painter`), the
  minimap/map/delve are intentionally 1:1.
- **Prewarm heavy canvas work off the interaction.** A multi-hundred-ms terrain render is
  painted a few rows per `requestIdleCallback` slice and cached, so opening the map never
  pays it synchronously (`hud.ts` `prewarmMapBg`).
- **Transform vs layout, honestly.** No blanket prefer-transform rule: reach for
  `transform`/`opacity` when an element actually MOVES every frame (nameplates), and lean on
  write-once + elision otherwise (FCT writes its screen-anchored `left`/`top` once at spawn;
  the bars write `width` through the elided writer).

The CSS token system, `@layer` order, browser matrix, and bundle discipline these painters
depend on are in `src/styles/CLAUDE.md`.

## hud.ts navigation map (one class `Hud`)
Every region is fenced by a `// ----` banner, so jump by grepping the banner (or the
named method) rather than a line number. `update()` is the per-frame entry;
`handleEvents(events)` feeds log/FCT/audio/banners (`onEvent` is a method on the
`meters` helper, not `Hud`). Regions in file order:
| Region |
|---|
| Fields / constructor / `OptionsHooks`,`ReportHooks` |
| Chat tabs / emote wheel |
| Portraits (canvas paint lives in `unit_portrait*`), icons, tooltips, money |
| Action bar (`hotbarActions`, `slotMapKey`, `BAR_ABILITY_SLOTS`, click/keybind dispatch) |
| Frame update (unit/target/combat state) |
| Minimap & world map (`toggleMap`, zone band) |
| Ashen Coliseum arena panel (`toggleArena`) |
| Events → log / FCT / audio / banners |
| 2v2 Fiesta HUD (score, respawn, augment picks) |
| Quest dialog (gossip) · Loot · Vendor |
| World Market (auction house: browse/sell/collect) |
| Bags · Character window · Spellbook |
| Confirm dialog + in-app text-input modal (replaces native `prompt`) |
| Talents & Specializations panel ('N', staged-edit + loadouts) |
| Quest log · Party frames · Player context menu |
| Social panel (friends/guild/ignore, online) |
| Prompts (party/trade/duel) · Trade window |
| Options menu (Esc) + keybind rebinding |
Toggle/open methods (`toggleBags`, `openVendor`, `openContextMenu`, …) are the
public surface `main.ts`/input call.

**New self-contained windows go in their own module, not a new banner section.**
`hud.ts` is the worst monolith to grow: a new window or panel that does not need `Hud`'s
private per-frame state belongs in its own `src/ui/` module the HUD composes (the
direction the HUD modularization is heading; see the root Modularity section). The pure
painters (`unit_portrait*`, `xp_bar.ts`) are the template: a host-agnostic core a Vitest
drives directly, plus a thin DOM/canvas consumer.

### Authoring a new HUD component (the recipe)
One recipe for a new window/panel OR a per-frame frame/bar, and for migrating one out of
`hud.ts` (the one `Hud` class nearly every PR touches; that is the merge-conflict tax this
pays down). Migrate one at a time, on the rule of three, never a big-bang split.
**Reference: the Vendor window (`vendor_view.ts` + `vendor_window.ts`, the first window
migrated this way) and the `unit_frame` family for a per-frame component.** Ordered steps:

(a) **Pure view-core** `src/ui/<name>_view.ts`: map `IWorld` (+ raw inputs) to a render
   model (which rows, prices, flags, geometry); DOM/Three/i18n-free; INSTANCE-PARAMETERIZED
   (take a descriptor/id, no hardcoded element id, no single-instance assumption);
   allocation-light if per-frame (reuse one container). NAME it `<name>_view.ts` or
   `<name>_core.ts` (NOT a bare name): the `architecture.test.ts` COMPLETENESS sweep asserts
   every on-disk `*_view`/`*_core` is registered, so the convention name is what makes a
   forgotten registration FAIL the guard instead of silently escaping the purity scan.
   Register it in the `UI_PURE_CORES` allowlist in `tests/architecture.test.ts`.
(b) **Core test** `tests/<name>_view.test.ts`: same-input-same-output (`expect(build()).toEqual(build())`
   for sim-derived data, see `tests/vendor_view.test.ts`); no `Math.random`/`Date.now`/
   `performance.now`; no DOM import. Feed BOTH a Sim-shaped and a `ClientWorld`-mirror stub
   for parity.
(c) **Thin painter** `src/ui/<name>_window.ts` (or `_painter.ts`): paints the panel /
   updates the nodes and wires callbacks via an injected `deps` object (`Hud`'s shared
   `itemIcon`/`moneyHtml`/`itemTooltip`/`attachTooltip` + the action callbacks); owns no
   state and never imports `Hud`. ALL DOM writes go through the `PainterHost` elided
   writers; it drives tokens / CSS vars, never a literal hex/px/color in TS (the per-painter
   no-magic-values source guard, e.g. `tests/action_bar_painter.test.ts`,
   `tests/minimap_painter.test.ts`). Interpolated names pass through `esc()`; a pure
   extraction reuses existing `t()` keys and adds none (Vendor added none). For item names
   import the shared `itemDisplayName` from `entity_i18n.ts`.
(d) **For chrome (a window/control):** satisfy the HUD-chrome WCAG 2.2 AA contract above
   (roles/aria, focus trap + return, steady `:focus-visible`, target-size, forced-colors).
(e) **For a hot (per-frame) component:** keep the core allocation-light and pass the perf
   gate (frameP95 + bounded burst); tier knobs read the static preset, not the governor; and
   apply the matching canvas/DOM hot-path technique (refs-once, pool + reconcile, offscreen
   cache, elide the resolve) from the per-frame performance contract above.
(f) **Reuse a FAMILY before building bespoke:** a unit-style frame is a new
   `UnitFramePainter` instance (`unit_frame.ts` + `unit_frame_painter.ts`); an extra action
   bar is another `ActionBarPainter` instance built from a new bar descriptor
   (`action_bar_view.ts` + `action_bar_painter.ts`).
   Adding the extra bars / raid frames is a follow-on feature that inherits the seam, not a
   refactor step.
(g) **`Hud` stays the orchestrator.** Keep `open<Window>`/`close<Window>` in `Hud`:
   cross-window coordination (`closeOtherWindows`, bag re-centring, mobile teardown, body
   classes) needs `Hud`'s private state. The per-render method (e.g. `renderVendor`) shrinks
   to: resolve the entity, build the view, call the module with `deps`. Keep the diff a
   move-plus-import, not a rewrite (root `extract-and-test` skill). Run the matching
   validation-matrix rows before committing.

## i18n - IMPORTANT (sparse-overlay model; contributors add ENGLISH ONLY)
The locale data is split across files. Touch the right one:
- `i18n.catalog/` (nested) is the **authoritative source catalog** and drives
  `TranslationKey = Leaves<typeof en, 6>`, the dotted-path type every `t()` call uses.
  It is a directory of English-valued domain modules (`shell.ts`, `hud.ts`,
  `hud_chrome.ts`, `abilities.ts`, `quests.ts`, `items.ts`, `game.ts`, `merge.ts`) plus
  `index.ts`, the barrel that assembles + exports `en`. Add a new English string in the
  matching domain module (was the single `i18n.en.ts` before the i18n.catalog domain split).
- `i18n.locales/<lang>.ts` are the 13 non-English **flat sparse overlays**
  (`Partial<Record<TranslationKey,string>>`), the ONLY files a translator edits. An
  omitted key is filled from English by the build and marked `pending` in the registry.
- `i18n.resolved.generated/` is the **generated dense table** the runtime imports — a
  directory of one dense per-locale slice + `index.ts` (barrel), `loaders.ts`
  (`LOCALE_LOADERS` + `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`), `pending.ts`, and the dev-only `en_XA.ts`
  (do not hand-edit). It is committed; regenerated by `npm run i18n:build`.
  `i18n.status.json` is the **registry** (translated/pending/blocked), regenerated by
  `npm run i18n:scan` but **gitignored** (~5 MB) — only the counts-only
  `i18n.status.summary.json` is committed.
- `i18n.ts` is the thin runtime: `t()`, `tOptional`, `tPlural` (CLDR cardinal plurals),
  `hasTranslation`, formatters (`formatNumber`/`formatDateTime`/`formatMoney`/`languageTag`),
  `getLanguage`/`setLanguage`/`isSupportedLanguage`, `supportedLanguages`. **The locale set
  derives from `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` in the generated `loaders.ts`** (14 = en + 13), not a
  `translations` map; add a code there (via the source overlays + regenerate) to make a
  locale selectable. **Lazy locale flip:** only `en`/`en_XA`/`pending`/`loaders` are eager;
  the 13 non-en slices load on demand via `await ensureLocaleLoaded(lang)` (one dynamic
  `import()` per content-hashed chunk; `prefetchLocale`/`isLocaleResident` complete the
  surface). `setLanguage` is synchronous and does NOT load — `main.ts` awaits
  `ensureLocaleLoaded` before localized paint and before each picker switch.

**Merge conflicts in the committed generated artifacts** (`i18n.status.summary.json`
is the usual one; also `i18n.resolved.sha256` and any `i18n.resolved.generated/` slice)
are **never hand-resolved**. Take either side to clear the markers, then run
`npm run i18n:gen` (build + admin + scan) to regenerate every committed artifact from
the merged source-of-truth (the `i18n.catalog/` modules + `i18n.locales/` overlays) and
`git add` the result. The output is deterministic, so a second `npm run i18n:gen` must
leave the tree clean — that idempotency is your proof the resolution is right (and the CI
i18n:gen freshness step checks the same thing). A rising `pending` count after merging a
`release/**` branch into a feature branch is expected (its new content is not yet
translated) and is fine at the PR-tier gate.

`t(key)` **throws on an untracked key in dev/test**, renders English for a `pending`
key on **non-release builds only**, and **hard-fails a pending key on a release build**
(`isReleaseBuild()` = `I18N_RELEASE=1` or `import.meta.env.PROD`). The HUD is fully
localized; prefer `t()` for new user-facing strings.

**Contributor workflow (add a player-visible string): add ENGLISH ONLY:**
1. Add the key to `en` (the matching `i18n.catalog/<domain>.ts` module) and render it
   through `t()`. **Never edit the 13
   `i18n.locales/<lang>.ts` overlays, and never put English/`// TODO`/a placeholder
   into one as a fake translation.** Leave the key omitted; the build English-fills it
   and the registry marks it `pending`. (Translating 13 locales per PR would drain
   small-plan token budgets; the maintainer batch-fills them at release.)
2. If the string originates in `src/sim/` or `server/` (which stay language-agnostic),
   register a matcher RULE in the table matching the emit's ORIGIN (`sim_i18n.ts` for a
   `src/sim/` emit, `server_i18n.ts` for a `server/` emit; the two are parallel mirrors)
   in the SAME change. The S3 guard accepts recognition by either matcher and fails if a
   new emit is recognized by neither.
3. Run `npm run i18n:scan` (and `npm run i18n:build`; if the resolved table changed,
   also `npm run i18n:hash -- --write`) and commit the regenerated files.
4. Open the PR. It is green at the **PR-tier gate** (no `I18N_RELEASE_TIER`), which does
   not require translations; `tsc` + the `t()` untracked-key throw still guarantee
   English completeness.

The maintainer fills the `pending` slice at release time via `npm run i18n:worklist`,
then ships from `release/**` where the **release-tier gate** (`I18N_RELEASE_TIER=1`)
hard-fails on any `pending` row. Run `I18N_RELEASE_TIER=1 npm test` locally to dry-run
that gate.
Full contributor + maintainer flow and the locked-terms glossary:
`docs/i18n-scaling/translation-workflow.md`.

**Where to put a new client key (catalog-domain gotcha).** Every catalog domain
EXCEPT `hud_chrome.ts` carries tsc-ENFORCED inline per-locale data (`shell`, `hud`,
`quests`, `items`, `abilities` hold inline `en:`/`es:`/… blocks; `game` uses parallel
`gameStrings<Lang>: typeof gameStrings` consts; `merge.ts` cross-refs), so adding a key
to one of their `en` blocks red-fails `tsc` (TS2719) until you fill every non-en block
too. For new HUD chrome, **add the key to `i18n.catalog/hud_chrome.ts` instead**
(namespace `hudChrome.*`): it is the ONLY English-only domain (a flat object, no
per-locale blocks), so an English-only add compiles and the translations live solely in
the overlays. **Never add `as const` to a catalog-domain object** — it narrows the
literal types and breaks the `en_XA` pseudo-locale.

**Formatters, not hand-built numbers.** Every user-visible number/date/percent/
coordinate/duration goes through `formatNumber` / `formatDateTime` / `formatMoney`
(this dir's `i18n.ts`). To keep English byte-identical to a historical hand-rolled
form, pass `useGrouping: false` + matching fraction-digit options (see `coords.ts`,
`meters.ts`, `xp_bar.ts`, `clock.ts`); units that reorder per locale go in a `t()`
key with the digits spliced as a `{placeholder}` (e.g. `hudChrome.meters.*`).

**Three client-side matchers re-localize `src/sim`/`server` English** (these stay
language-agnostic): the hud-local arms `localizeErrorText`/`localizeSystemText`/
`localizeLootText` (→ `t()` keys), then `server_i18n.ts` (`localizeServerText`), then
`sim_i18n.ts` (`localizeSimText`). They run in that order; the S3 drift guard
(`tests/localization_fixes.test.ts`) accepts recognition by any of the three. Dev-
channel text (`console.*`, thrown errors) stays English and is NOT matched.

**Entity & talent names** localize through their own resolvers here, not raw `t()`:
`world_entity_i18n.ts` is the single ENGLISH source for mob/NPC/quest/zone/dungeon
names + narratives (its `.en` slice spreads into the catalog); `entity_i18n.ts`
(`tEntity`) localizes those at runtime; `talent_i18n.ts` localizes talent
titles/descriptions. A new world/talent name belongs in `world_entity_i18n.ts` (or the
talent source), with the translations living in the overlays like any other key.

## icons.ts — procedural, no image files
Icons are composed on a canvas at runtime and cached as PNG data URLs — there are
**no icon image assets**. Public API: `iconDataUrl(kind, id, size)` where `kind`
is `'ability' | 'item' | 'aura' | 'crest'`; plus `QUALITY_COLOR`.
Each icon is a recipe: `{ bg, pal, prims, fx? }` (`IconRecipe`) drawn over a
`BACKGROUNDS` radial + `PALETTES` tint with vector `PRIMITIVES` and optional `FX`.
Unknown ids fall back via `abilityFallback`/`itemFallback` (school + name
keywords), so every id always renders.
- **Add an icon for a known id:** add an entry to `ABILITY_RECIPES` /
  `ITEM_RECIPES` / `AURA_RECIPES` / `CREST_RECIPES` using the `r(bg, pal, prims, fx?)` helper
  (e.g. `r('fire','blood',['sword','flame'])`; `TL/TR/BL/BR/BIG` are placement
  shorthands). New visuals need a new `PRIMITIVES` painter (centered at 0,0,
  ~100×100 space, r≤36, light top-left).

## Small modules
These are the **pure-core + thin-consumer** split the root CLAUDE.md Conventions
ask for: presentation/domain logic lifted out of `hud.ts` into a small,
host-agnostic module a Vitest test imports directly, with the DOM/canvas side kept
thin. Follow this shape for new/updated features whose logic is worth reusing or
unit-testing.
- **unit_portrait.ts** / **unit_portrait_painter.ts**: the circular
  player/target-frame portrait. The pure core (`unit_portrait.ts`, DOM-free,
  unit-tested in `tests/unit_portrait.test.ts`) holds the geometry + crest-id
  resolution: HiDPI backing-store sizing (`portraitBackingPx`), crest
  overscan-to-fill the disc (`overscanRect`/`CREST_OVERSCAN`), and family/NPC
  crest ids (`crestIdForEntity`). The painter (`UnitPortraitPainter`) is the thin
  consumer: DPR-aware canvas backing store, crest/headshot blit, decoded-image
  cache. Player and target frames share one implementation; `hud.ts` only routes
  the framed unit to it. Screenshot harness: `scripts/target_frame_visual.mjs`.
- **xp_bar.ts** — pure `xpBarView()`, no DOM (snapshot-tested). Shows the
  post-cap **virtual level** `Lv 20 (+N)` + lifetime total when overflow is on;
  classic "MAX LEVEL" when off. See `virtualLevelProgress` in `sim/types`.
- **meters.ts** — DPS/HPS/threat meters, encounter-segmented; threat reads
  the mob's real `entity.threat` hate table. Uses `performance.now()` (UI timing
  only — fine here; that ban is sim-only).
- **vendor_view.ts** / **vendor_window.ts**: the merchant vendor window, and the
  first full window migrated out of `hud.ts` by the "Extracting a HUD window"
  recipe above. The pure **view** (`vendor_view.ts`, DOM/i18n-free,
  unit-tested in `tests/vendor_view.test.ts`) is `buildVendorView`, which decides
  the sellable goods rows (item exists + has a buyValue) and the redeemable buyback
  rows (item exists + count > 0) with prices. The thin **consumer**
  (`vendor_window.ts`, `renderVendorWindow`) paints `#vendor-window` from that view
  and takes `Hud`'s shared painters plus the buy/buyback/close callbacks as injected
  `deps`. `Hud` keeps `openVendor`/`closeVendor` (cross-window orchestration);
  `renderVendor` is now a thin bridge.
- **player_context_menu.ts** — pure `chatPlayerContextActions()` returning
  whisper/invite/friend/ignore/report actions for the right-click-player menu.
- **auth_utils.ts** — login/char-select form helpers: password toggle, ARIA
  validity sync, `validateCharacterName` (mirrors the server regex).
- **stat_tooltip.ts** / **stat_tooltip_view.ts**: the character-screen (C panel)
  stat hover tooltips. The pure **core** (`stat_tooltip.ts`, DOM/i18n-free,
  reconciled against `recalcPlayerStats` in `tests/stat_tooltip.test.ts`) builds the
  structured `StatTooltipModel` (which class-aware effect lines a stat contributes
  and their live values) and exposes `weaponDps`. The pure **view**
  (`stat_tooltip_view.ts`, unit-tested in `tests/stat_tooltip_view.test.ts`) turns a
  model into the floating tooltip HTML, the visually-hidden aria breakdown, and the
  focusable `statCellHtml` markup, taking i18n + `formatNumber` as an injected
  `StatTooltipI18n` so it never imports the runtime. `hud.ts` is the thin consumer:
  `statModel()` bridges the live sim to the core, then it hands the model to the view.
- **esc.ts**: the one canonical HTML escaper (`esc`) for innerHTML / attribute
  interpolation, shared by `hud.ts`, `portrait_chip.ts`, and the small view modules
  (the src/ui rule "all HTML interpolation goes through `esc()`"); escapes `& < > " '`.
